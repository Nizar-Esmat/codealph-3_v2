# Social Media Dashboard
## Overview
### The Social Media Dashboard project is a web application that provides users with a centralized platform to monitor their social media presence across various social media platforms.
### With this dashboard, users can conveniently track their followers, engagement metrics, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) for platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.
#### Note: This project does not currently have a real API integration with social media platforms. However, the structure is in place to easily add API integrations in the future.
